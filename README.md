# 💳 CardGuard: Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard

CardGuard is a real-time fraud detection system designed to process streaming transaction data using Apache Kafka, apply a trained machine learning model, and display predictions via a sleek Streamlit-based dashboard.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 🔁 Kafka Message Flow

- `producer.py`: Reads transactions from `cleaned_data.csv` and sends each as a JSON message to the Kafka topic `fraud-detection`.
- `consumer.py`: Consumes messages from Kafka and makes predictions using a pre-trained model.
- `app.py`: Streamlit frontend that polls for the latest transaction, predicts if it's FRAUD or SAFE, and displays the result.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- Trained on the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
- Features include anonymized V1–V28 PCA components, Time, and Amount.
- Model used: Logistic Regression (saved as `logistic_model.pkl` using `joblib`).

## 🚀 Setup & Running Locally

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.10+
- pip packages: `pandas`, `joblib`, `kafka-python`, `streamlit`

### 🐳 1. Start Kafka + Zookeeper with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### ▶️ 2. Run the Kafka Producer (in one terminal)

```bash
cd app
python producer.py
```

### 🧾 3. Run the Streamlit Dashboard (in another terminal)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
